This project aims to create a local time synchronised
clock on a webpage.

The drawing assets have been created using Inkscape,
wherein the static and dynamic parts have been
segregated by layers.  Thus the export was separately
possible and controlled.

## The Storyboard


**Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text of the printing
and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
release of *Letraset sheets* containing Lorem Ipsum
passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
Lorem Ipsum.
